The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You have within you right now, everything you need to deal with whatever the world can throw at you.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
